# Emotion and Facial Key-Point Detection

This project aims to classify peopleâ€™s emotions based on their facial images and predict key facial points using deep learning models. It involves training and deploying systems to monitor facial emotions and expressions automatically.

## Project Overview

### Part 1: Key Facial Points Detection
* **Objective:** Predict the x and y coordinates of 15 key facial points.
* **Dataset:** Includes over 2000 images with facial key-point annotations.
* **Approach:** Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Residual Blocks (ResNet) to detect key facial points.

### Part 2: Facial Expression (Emotion) Detection
* **Objective:** Classify facial emotions into 5 categories:
  * 0: Angry ðŸ˜¡
  * 1: Disgust ðŸ˜–
  * 2: Sad ðŸ˜”
  * 3: Happy ðŸ˜„
  * 4: Surprise ðŸ˜²
* **Dataset:** Contains more than 20,000 labeled facial images.
